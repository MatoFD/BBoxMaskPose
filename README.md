## Results & Weights

### Pose

Results on COCO val and OCHuman val of different Human Pose Estimation (HPE) methods. We provide trained weights for both MaskPose (introeuced in the paper) and ViTPose trained in the multi-dataset setup. Multi-dataset ViTPose is not new but their weights are not compatible with popular MMPose 2.0 codebase. We retrained theme in the MMPose 2.0 environment. 

| Model      | Datasets      | COCO AP | OCHuman AP | weights | notes                                             |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ViTPose-b  | COCO          | 0.90    | 0.92       | ---     | weights from MMPose repo                          |
| ViTPose-b  | COCO+AIC+MPII | 0.90    | 0.92       | LINK    | multi-dataset training compatible with MMPose 2.0 |
| MaskPose-b | COCO+AIC+MPII | 0.90    | 0.92       | LINK    |                                                   |

### Detection

We provide weights of the RTMDet-l trained on masked-out instances. It is compatible with RTMDet configs in MMDetection.

| Model                | Datasets | COCO AP | OCHuman AP | weights | notes                                            |
| -------------------- | -------- | ------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| RTMDet-l-ins         | COCO     | 0.90    | 0.92       | ---     |                                                  |
| RTMDet-l-ins-maskout | COCO     | 0.90    | 0.92       | LINK    | Fine-tuned weights ignoring masked-out instances |
