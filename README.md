## Description

This repository provides the code and model weights for the paper *Detection, Segmentation, and Pose Estimation for Multiple Bodies: Closing the Virtuous Circle*.

The code is a modified version of [MMPose 2.0](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose) with the following key changes:
- Support for multi-dataset training of ViTPose, previously implemented in the official ViTPose repository but absent in MMPose.
- Added `MaskBackground` data augmentation to train MaskPose.
- Includes weights for MaskPose and RTMDet to reproduce BBox-Mask-Pose results from the paper.

Note: The code has not undergone extensive cross-platform testing and may contain bugs. If you encounter issues, please report them via the repository's issue tracker.

If you use this work, kindly cite it using the reference provided below.

## News

- 02 Dec 2024: The code is available
- 23 Nov 2024: The [project website](https://MiraPurkrabek.github.io/BBox-Mask-Pose) is on


## Installation
  
The code builds on [MMPose](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose). Install its dependencies simply with:

```console
pip install mmengine
mim install "mmcv>=2.0.1"
mim install "mmdet>=3.1.0"
```

And then install our code using 

```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```

## Results & Weights

### Pose

Results on COCO val and OCHuman val of different Human Pose Estimation (HPE) methods. All results are with detection from [RTMDet-l](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection/tree/main/configs/rtmdet) from MMDetection.

We provide trained weights for both MaskPose (introduced in the paper) and ViTPose trained in the multi-dataset setup. Multi-dataset ViTPose is not new but their weights are not compatible with popular MMPose 2.0 codebase. We retrained theme in the MMPose 2.0 environment. 

| Model      | Datasets      | COCO AP | OCHuman AP | weights | notes                                             |
| ---------- | ------------- | ------- | ---------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ViTPose-b  | COCO+AIC+MPII | 76.3    | 42.5       | [download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y6kSpl-RkdYtv9vsCogZpQW1RWyPKzwS/view?usp=sharing)    | multi-dataset training compatible with MMPose 2.0 |
| MaskPose-b | COCO+AIC+MPII | 76.4    | 45.3       | [download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aq8eVxDH8yMIDiH66neXQXE6_lCWfGb0/view?usp=sharing)    |                                                   |

### Detection

To run BBox-Mask-Pose loop, you also need to adapt a detector. We fine-tuned RTMDet-l with mask-out data augmentation as shown in the paper. Weights of the fine-tuned model (compatible with MMDetection config) is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1edMVlIgxT0E3lAYtgKipjWhfOmMfFepR/view?usp=sharing).
